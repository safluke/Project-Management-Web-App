# Project-Management-Web-App
App to help manage deadlines

In this project I make use of the Java Spring Boot Framework to create a backend application that is fully CRUD functional. Data is persisted onto a relational database and can be accessed via allowed REST API endpoints. To test
application a series of unit tests were designed on Mockito and POSTMAN was used to mimic a front-end interface.
This has been progressed so that a front-end for this application has been made using HTML CSS and Javascript. Dilligence in secure practise and assigning user access roles help to maintain the security of the database. 

The plannning of this project was done using a kanban board using github projects. Data was routinely uploaded onto github repositories to allow for version control.
